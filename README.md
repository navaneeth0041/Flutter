## FormulaHub (The Formula app)

This is a basic app created with the help of flutter. App consists of a demo login page(backend is not set yet), which 
leads to onboarding screen and then to a welcome and class selecting pages. Inside the app the user can select the subject
and each subject is divided into various chapters. Each chapter consists of formula cards consisting of important formulas
from that chapter. The card is presented with a slider by which the user can navigate through the cards. The drawer in the
formula page is equipped with a navigation enabled to the card adding page, by which the user can add cards from their side
through a modalbottomsheet. This addinf feature have LaTex feature by which the formulas entered by the user in LaTex 
format will be changed to normal form while displaying(used flutter_math_fork).
